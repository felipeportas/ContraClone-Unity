# Contra Clone
An attempt to make a open source clone of **Contra III: The Alien Wars in Unity**. 

## Overview
This game will attempt to copy 1:1 all the original mechanics the best we can with what we have including intro cinematic and local co-op control functionality. We will also try to improve upon some of the original systems such as adding networking to the 2 player menu so you can play with friends. Improving the outdated movement systems that restrict you from combining some actions. Even adding an options menu with more than 3 settings and audio split into controllable channels for a better playing experience. 

## Notes
If you would like to help us work on this project feel free to fork this project and suggest additions and/or changes! 

*This project may be put on hold for an undetermined amount of time at any point in the development process due to things coming up. Also we are only currently a team of two (with a third having the possibility to show up) so development will be slow as we are primarily using this project to learn many aspects of Unity.*
